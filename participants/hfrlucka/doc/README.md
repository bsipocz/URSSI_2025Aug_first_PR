This function returns the factorial of a given number, i.e., the product of all the positive integers from 1 to the number. For example, 4 factorial, usually written 4!, is equal to 24 (1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24).

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(4)
    24

This is a function that lists out the Fibonacci sequence, or the sequence of numbers, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... , in which each successive number is equal to the sum of the two preceding numbers, up to the given number.

    >>> fibonnacci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
