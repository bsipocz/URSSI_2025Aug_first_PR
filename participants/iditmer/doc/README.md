The simple_functions file contains two functions for calculations. One computes the factorial of its input:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(8)
    40320

And the other calculates elements of the Fibonacci sequence:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
