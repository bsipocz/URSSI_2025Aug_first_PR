# My Happy Documentation

Ok, so I guess you are reading this because you want to use my code.
There are some functions that do nice stuff, like factorial.

```python
from pr_tutorial.simple_functions import factorial
factorial(10)
```

Output:

```python
3628800
```

And this other part does a Fibonacchi thing, check it out:

```python
from pr_tutorial.simple_functions import fibonacci
fibonacci(100)
```

Output:

```python
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
```

Check the actual code on the [pr_tutorial](./pr_tutorial/) directory.

If it does not work check the main repository to see the [original state of the file](../../../README.md).
