Hello thank you for wanting to use my code. We have two functions included. The first is a prime number checker:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

and the second one is a fibonnacci loop:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

Have fun!
