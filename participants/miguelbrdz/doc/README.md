As my good friend Obi-Wan says: Hello there!. So, I guess you are reading this cuz you wanna use my code, welcome then. There are some
functions that can do some stuf and thats:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

and this other part does something else.  I forget why that I did it, but this is the Fibonacci sequence:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

If you can't use it, that is fantastic, be my guest!
